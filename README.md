 Model:
 The Model component is responsible for the core functionality of the system. It manages the underlying  data structures, such as storing and organizing account information, handling file operations for saving and  loading accounts, and managing account transactions like deposits and withdrawals.
 
  View:
 The View component represents the user interface (UI) of the system. It provides users with a  visual   representation of the account data and allows them to interact with it. Users can view a list of    accounts,  perform operations like depositing or withdrawing money, and receive feedback on their actions.
 
  Controller:
  The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It interprets user actions from the       View and translates them into operations that the Model can understand. For example, when a user clicks  a  "Deposit" button in the View, the Controller handles the request and instructs the Model to update the  corresponding account.
 Synchronization and Multitasking
 One notable feature of the project is its ability to handle concurrent access from multiple users or  processes. This means that multiple users can interact with the system simultaneously without risking data  corruption or inconsistency. For instance, if two users attempt to deposit funds into the same account  concurrently, the system ensures that the transactions are processed correctly and the account balance  remains accurate.
 Data Integrity and Conflict Resolution
 To maintain data integrity, the project employs strategies to resolve conflicts that may arise when multiple  components attempt to modify the same account simultaneously. By implementing synchronization  mechanisms and conflict resolution algorithms, the system ensures that changes to account data are applied  consistently and accurately across all components.
